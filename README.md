# ReduxSimpleStarter

Personal notes:
- clone clean copy of ReduxSimpleStarter and name it
- create new repository in github
- in terminal:
  - git init
  - git add .
  - git commit -m "First commit"
  - git remote set-url origin https://github.com/gdevany/CityTempEtc.git  <-copy paste this from github page of newly created new repository
  - git remote -v  <- to verify origin is correct
  - git push origin
